# Baldur Hold'em
Played in taverns, inns, and dungeons across the material plane. A favorite among nobles, brigands and anyone favoring chance over certainty. Based on elements of Texas and Omaha Hold'em, roll dice in this quick and fun mini-game that can be used to create hooks, NPC introductions, or simply a curiosity.

## Summary
During the first round. each player character rolls 3d20 in the open. The DM rolls 4d20 in secret, which represent the best NPC hand at the table regardless of the number of NPCs playing. Like real world poker, there are a set of 5 community dice that all PCs and NPCs share to make the best 5 dice "hand". These community dice are rolled in two additional rounds, 3 dice in the second round and the final 2 dice in the third round. Each time dice are rolled, players and NPCs choose whether they remain in the "hand" and at the end, the best hand (5 dice) wins.

## Rules
### Running The Game
1. **Round 1** - Each PC rolls 3d20 in the open and the DM rolls 4d20 in secret. (Hole Cards)
1. PCs and NPCs post their ante (use 1 GP as default)
1. **Round 2** - The DM rolls community 3d20 (The Flop) 
1. PCs and half of the remaining NPCs (minimum 1) add double ante (2 GP) to the pot to stay in the hand.
1. **Round 3** - The DM rolls community 2d20 (The Void)
1. PCs and the last NPC add triple ante (3 GP) to the pot to stay in the hand.
1. The DM chooses 2 of their d20s to reveal, representing the strongest NPC hand that stayed in.
1. The best 5 dice hand wins the pot.

### Key Details
- To make a 5 dice hand, PCs and NPCs *<u>must use precisely 2</u>* of their rolled d20s in conjuntion with 3 community d20s.
- A **natural 20** is considered a **wild** for making a straight, except for community dice.
  - Example: A PC's "hole cards" are 20,3,9. The community dice show 2,7,10,11,19. The PC would have a straight comprised of a 7,20,9,10,11
  - 2 natural 20s rolled can both be used to make a straight.
- If multiple PC or NPC have the same ranked hands (both have a pair), the highest numerical hand wins.
  - If multiple PC or NPC have the same numerical ranked hand, the remaining dice in the 5 dice hand are used to break ties.

### Valid Hands (Ranked)

- **5 of a Kind** (0.005%, 5 of a single number)
  - Example: 7,7,7,7,7
- **4 of a Kind** (0.340%, 4 of a single number)
  - Example: 9,9,9,9
- **Full House** (1.000%, 3 of a kind + a Pair)
  - Example: 19,19,19,2,2
- **Straight** (1.231%, 5 dice in consecutive order)
  - Example: 12,13,14,15,16
